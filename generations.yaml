    description: "The Dodge Journey was a mid-size crossover SUV that combined elements of a minivan with SUV styling. Built on Chrysler's JC platform shared with the Avenger sedan, it featured a front-wheel drive layout with available all-wheel drive. The exterior design was relatively conservative, focusing on practicality with a tall roofline and upright stance. Initially available with a 2.4L four-cylinder or 3.5L V6 (later replaced by the Pentastar 3.6L V6), the Journey offered versatile family transportation with seating for up to seven passengers across three rows. The interior was notable for its clever storage solutions, including under-floor compartments and a front passenger seat with a hidden storage bin. A significant refresh in 2011 substantially improved the interior quality and introduced the Uconnect infotainment system. Despite receiving only minor updates for the remainder of its production run, the Journey maintained steady sales by offering substantial value with competitive pricing and practical features. Production ended in 2020 without a direct replacement, as Dodge shifted focus to performance-oriented vehicles and SUVs. In some international markets, particularly China and Latin America, a second-generation Journey (based on the GAC GS5) was introduced, but this model was unrelated to the North American version and was not sold in the United States."
